# Assignment for the position of Junior Front-end Developer at the Data Science team at Wunderman Thompson London

**May 2021**

## Install Dependencies

To install the required dependencies user the following command:

`npm install`

## Main ask

Given the base HTML and CSS that we give you, could you make it look a bit nicer and more reactive?

## Have in mind

You may use any tools you want or used in the past. Use what you are most comfortable with.
We will give you the opportunity to walk us through the solution in the last stage interview, we are not interested in you finishing the job but getting to know your thought process.
This should not take more than 4 hours and you will have until Midnight on Tuesday 11th of May to work on it.
We do not expect a very polished result, but rather

1. Test literacy in responsiveness (JS / React), and
2. Test literacy in styling (CSS).

## Remember

We are looking for a **junior software developer**, so we do not intend you to know everything or finish the assignment.
