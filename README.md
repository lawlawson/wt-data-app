## About
I was given a written brief and asked to design and build a small program with minimal functionality that takes employee data and allows the users to search and filter data based on certain requirements. 

I have some dummy chart data that I have added for a visual aesthetics more than anything. I used Recharts for this, a composable charting library built on React components.

## How to run program

### Install Dependencies

To install the required dependencies user the following command:

`npm install`

Once dependencies have been installed you have to run the application. Do this with the following command:

`npm start`
